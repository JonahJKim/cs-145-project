### Installation

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/THUDM/paper-source-trace.git
cd paper-source-trace
```

Please install dependencies by

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1I_HZXBx7U0UsRHJL5JJagw?pwd=bft3) with password bft3.

The paper XML files are generated by [Grobid](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/) APIs from paper pdfs.

## How to Run
```bash
cd $project_path
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='?'  # specify which GPU(s) to be used

python rule.py  # rule-based method
python bert.py  # BERT-based method
python net_emb.py  # network embedding based method (ProNE)
```
